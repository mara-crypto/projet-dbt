Job Description

Faire leverages the power of machine learning and data insights to revolutionize... the wholesale industry, enabling local retailers to compete against giants like Amazon and big box stores.

At Faire, the Data Science team is responsible for creating and maintaining a diverse range of algorithms and models that power our marketplace. We are dedicated to building machine learning models that help our customers thrive.

We have several Intern positions on the following 3 Data Science teams:

We're looking for someone with experience working on projects related to the fields above and who are eager to wake up ready to take a problem end-to-end, dive into our information-rich databases, and produce actionable insights.

Our internships are paid and 12-to-14 weeks in duration. We have flexible start dates and are open to extending internship durations based on need and mutual fit.

What you will be doing:
• Define, plan and execute cutting-edge machine learning or other new algorithms that will be a/b tested with guidance from a manager or technical lead

Roles that list only a country in the location are eligible for fully remote work in that country or in- office work at a Faire office in that country, provided employees are located in the registered country/province/state. Roles with only a city location are eligible for in-office or hybrid office work in that city. Our talent team will work with candidates to determine what locations and roles are eligible for each option.

Software Development Internship (Data Engineering)

Requisition ID:
R020710

Job Description:

Software Development Internship (Data Engineering)
Demonware (Activision), Vancouver

September 2023

Interns will be required to be onsite at the Demonware Vancouver office following the team's work schedule (hybrid, 3 days a week), a relocation package may be offered depending on eligibility.

The Company

Demonware is a member of the Activision family of studios. We work alongside engineers and creatives at our AAA partner studios and deliver the online and data services required by our franchises. We craft, develop, and host services for some of the world’s biggest video game franchises, including Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot.

We are a technology company and dedicated to openness. This means collaborating to tackle problems, the freedom to talk to anyone, and the best idea wins. We take the work seriously; ourselves, not so much!

The Team

Demonware's data team is... responsible for crafting the services and infrastructure that ingest the billions of events our games emit every single day. At this scale, the challenges we face empower our engineers to flex their creative engineering muscles. When we get things right the analysts, studios and developers that interact with our systems can rapidly go from question to insight without ever having to get in touch with us.

The Demonware data team also works with studios to model and instrument the things that matter. We work with our customers to ship data forward applications, ensure compliance of data produced and coordinate the quality throughout.

Big company challenges, small company culture

As a team, we solve tough problems on a day-to-day basis, and interns have a huge impact on what we do. We’ve had interns own and build key components of our production pipeline and play a meaningful role in improving the delivery of data throughout the organization.

We also like to have fun while we’re working hard. We dress casually, we have flexible hours, and we have phenomenal coffee.

The first step of the hiring process is the Data Platform & Services Internship Challenge:

https://app.codility.com/public-link/Demonware-Data-Services-Internship-Challenge-2023/

The Role
• Design, develop, and support scalable and efficient data applications, tools and frameworks
• Assist in developing solutions around our big data platforms using technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Airflow, Spark-Streaming, Flink, Beam, and others
• Development of APIs & microservices to access, transform and deliver analytics data
• Collaborate closely with other engineers on the data team who are responsible for managing various aspects of our data footprint including data instrumentation, ingestion, streaming, processing, transformation, and visualization
• Creating tools to automate all the things!

We’re open to work terms of 8, 12, or 16 months. Generally, the longer the term is preferred as you get more in-depth experience.

Requirements
• Comfortable with one or more computer programming languages (Python, Scala, Java, Kotlin, etc.)
• Understanding of SQL−based and relational databases
• A good grasp of fundamental algorithms and data structures
• Excellent debugging and analytical skills
• Passion for working with big data technologies
• Interest in the data creation lifecycle, from 1's and 0's to driving business decisions
• Can identify complex problems and find simple solutions
• Can clearly communicate technical concepts in plain English

Nice-to-haves
• Linux/Unix command line and scripting knowledge
• Experience with distributed software development (scalability, efficiency)
• Experience working with Big Data (Kafka, PubSub, Spark, Presto, Flink, Beam, etc.)
• Experience working with AWS, GCP, or Azure cloud
• Experience with CI/CD, unit and integration testing, orchestration and containerization tools e.g. GitHub, Jenkins, Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, etc

We’re looking for the same qualities as Joel Spolsky: “smart, and gets things done”. For that reason, we welcome your application even if your work experience is limited and you haven’t yet built up a mile-long resume.

Please list any additional experience you have with Linux at home, any programming-related hobbies and resulting projects, any interesting school assignments you worked on, any open source involvement and a link to your code repository and/or blog.

Perks
• Complimentary breakfast, lunch, and drinks from a fully stocked kitchen
• BBQs and Lunch & Learns
• City-center office location
• Vacation allowance
• Competitive pay
• Free games

How to Apply

You can apply directly through your Coop office or directly apply at demonware.net

If you are not applying through your school program, please submit your resume, cover letter (optional but preferred) and a copy of your most recent school transcripts.

As part of the application process, you'll start by completing an online coding challenge.

Once you have completed the challenge, our hiring teams will review your results and your application documents.

Below you will find the link to the Codility website where the challenge is hosted. You will need a full 135 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete the challenge.

Coding Challenge:

We love hearing from anyone who is enthusiastic about changing the games industry. Not sure you meet all qualifications? Let us decide! Research shows that women and members of other under-represented groups tend to not apply to jobs when they think they may not meet every qualification, when, in fact, they often do!
